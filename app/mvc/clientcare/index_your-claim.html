						<ol>
							<li id="1_1">What happens next</li>
							<div class="ppi-agreement-info" >
								We will write to the Defendant asking them to admit liability for your claim and to pay you compensation. If we need any documentary evidence in relation to your payment protection insurance (PPI) policy before writing to the other side, then we will contact you straight away.
								<br><br>
								Please note that it is not possible for you to have more than one organisation simultaneously acting for you to claim your compensation. If you currently have any other organisation acting for you, please contact us immediately. If we carry out work on your behalf but we cannot recover your compensation because you have also instructed another organisation to do so, you will be liable to pay us our Guaranteed Charges (see section 2.1 below).
								<br><br>
								Under the relevant court rules we must allow the Defendant 1 month to investigate and consider your claim before we can take any further action. However many Defendants delay or refuse to pay compensation within this period, and if this is the case then we will advise you whether it is appropriate to start court proceedings.
								<br><br>
								Once court proceedings are commenced almost all cases settle without a court hearing taking place but please note that if ultimately there is a hearing, then you may need to attend court.
							</div>


							<li id="1_2">How we will deal with your claim</li>
							<div class="ppi-agreement-info" >
								Your claim will be dealt with by our experienced legal team, and Richard Gilbert, senior solicitor and our Head of Litigation, will have responsibility for the overall supervision of your claim.
								<br><br>
								For general enquiries and updates on your claim then you can speak to anyone in our legal team, who can be contacted by telephone on 0203 074 1100, or by email on team@ppisolicitors.co.uk
								<br><br>
								Our office is open between 9am to 5.30pm.
							</div>


							<li id="1_3">Communicating with you</li>
							<div class="ppi-agreement-info" >
								We will update you regularly (at least once a month), even if it just to let you know that the previous position remains unchanged, and we will always attempt to use plain language to explain the position. If you give us your email address, then all our written communications with you will be by e-mail, otherwise we will write to you at the address provided. We will progress your claim as quickly as possible, but we are required by the courts to give Defendants a reasonable time to reply and some Defendants will try to discourage claims by making it as hard as possible to claim and by deliberately causing delays, so please bear with us.
								<br><br>
								If the Defendant offers you Compensation that is less than the amount we believe you are entitled to receive, then we will contact you and advise you on whether that offer should be accepted. You are not obliged to accept that advice, and sections 2.4 and 2.6 below set out what happens if you do not wish to accept an offer which we believe is reasonable and should be accepted.
								<br><br>
								Throughout this document “Compensation” includes:
								<br><br>
								a)	any interest paid to you, or<br>
								b)	any monies paid directly to you by the Defendant or<br>
								c)	any liability you have to the Defendant (including interest) which the Defendant agrees to forego or not pursue.<br>
								<br>
								and “Defendant” includes any organisation with which the Defendant may be associated, or which is associated with this claim.
							</div>


							<li id="1_4">The service we provide</li>
							<div class="ppi-agreement-info" >
								We will be acting for you on a “No win, no fee” basis, i.e. normally we will only charge you our fees if your case ends successfully and you are paid Compensation but the details are set out in section 2 below.
								<br><br>

								A “Damages Based Agreement” (sections 2.3 and 2.4) will be in place from the beginning of your claim, but if you are forced to issue proceedings and the Defendant serves a defence, then this agreement will end and a “Conditional Fee Agreement” (sections 2.5 and 2.6) will take its place. The change between these 2 agreements will be automatic - there will be nothing for you to sign or do.
								<br><br>

								The agreements work in a very similar way to each other and the fees that apply under both agreements, are fully set out below in section 2.
								<br><br>

								The Damages Based Agreement (“DBA”) and an explanation of it, is at sections 2.3 and 2.4. The Conditional Fee Agreement (“CFA”) and an explanation of it, is at sections 2.5 and 2.6. The terms of those two documents form a contract between us and override anything in this information pack, so it is important that you read and understand sections 2.3 to 2.6 carefully. We will also where necessary arrange to purchase “After The Event” legal expense insurance policy (“ATE Insurance”) on your behalf if you do not already have such cover (see section 3.2). In this document we refer to all 3 items (the DBA, CFA and your ATE Insurance policy) as “Your Contract With Us”. If you have any queries about them, please do not hesitate to contact us.
								<br><br>

								The service we will provide to you will include the following:
								<br><br>

								•	We will review your claim regularly.<br>
								•	We will advise you of any changes in the law.<br>
								•	We will advise you of any circumstances and risks of which we are aware that could affect the outcome of your claim.<br>
								•	We will issue court proceedings on your behalf whenever necessary<br>
								<br>
								In return, you must:
								<br><br>
								•	Provide us where necessary with clear, prompt and accurate instructions.<br>
								•	Provide us with all documentation required to pursue your claim.<br>
								<br>
								Please also note that (as with all solicitor services) there is no legal requirement for you to be represented by a solicitor firm and you could yourself carry out all and any of the work involved in this claim.

							</div>


							<li id="1_5">Sending you your compensation</li>
							<div class="ppi-agreement-info" >
								By instructing us, you are specifically requiring and authorising us to receive your Compensation on your behalf. This is important because Defendants sometimes (wrongly) refuse to send the Compensation unless we are specifically authorised to receive it.
								<br><br>
								If you receive any offer, payment or communication from the Defendant, you must let us know immediately and not take any steps in relation to that communication until you have heard back from us. If you do not, there is a risk that you may accidentally prejudice your claim or make it impossible to pursue the Defendant in which event you will be liable to pay for that work and any legal costs which the Defendant is entitled to claim.
								<br><br>
								If we recover your Compensation, we will hold any money paid to us in our client account. We will then deduct our charges and send the Compensation to you as quickly as possible.
								<br><br>
								If a Defendant does not pay the Compensation to us, but instead sends us a cheque made payable to you, then we will not be obliged to send you that cheque until you have paid us Our Guaranteed Charges (defined in section 2.1 below).
								<br><br>
								If we have not received full payment of our Guaranteed Charges 14 days after we have notified you of the Guaranteed Charge then we will return the Compensation cheque to the Defendant and ask them to make payment directly to us.
								<br><br>
								If a Defendant pays any Compensation directly to you, then you will be liable to pay Our Guaranteed Charges. If we are advised by a Defendant that they have paid any Compensation directly to you, we will ask you to confirm whether or not you have received it. If you do not within 14 days tell us whether or not you have received it, then you will be liable to pay Our Guaranteed Charges calculated on the basis that the sum notified by the Defendant has been paid to you. If neither you nor the Defendant inform us of the sum you have received then you will be liable to pay Our Guaranteed Charges, based on our reasonable calculation of the damages interest and costs due to you.
								<br><br>
								We will pay you interest on your money if in the circumstances it is fair and reasonable to do so. Since the interest we can earn on this money is currently very low, and since we will normally only hold your money for a very short period, any interest will be extremely small. For that reason we will not pay you any interest on the money we temporarily hold for you in our client account unless the interest exceeds £20.
								<br><br>
								Where we pay money to you, we will ask you to provide your bank details in writing and will pay it to you by electronic bank transfer (BACS). Please note that we cannot send the money to someone other than yourself. It will not be paid in cash and payment by cheque or to an overseas bank will incur an extra charge (see section 2.1).
