						<ol>
							<li id="1_1">What happens next</li>
							<div class="ppi-agreement-info" >
								We will write to the Defendant asking them to admit liability for your claim and to pay you compensation. If we need any documentary evidence in relation to your payment protection insurance (PPI) policy before writing to the other side, then we will contact you straight away.
								<br><br>
								Please note that it is not possible for you to have more than one organisation simultaneously acting for you to claim your compensation. If you currently have any other organisation acting for you, please contact us immediately. If we carry out work on your behalf but we cannot recover your compensation because you have also instructed another organisation to do so, you will be liable to pay us our Guaranteed Charges (see section 2.1 below).
								<br><br>
								Under the relevant court rules we must allow the Defendant 1 month to investigate and consider your claim before we can take any further action. However many Defendants delay or refuse to pay compensation within this period, and if this is the case then we will advise you whether it is appropriate to start court proceedings.
								<br><br>
								Once court proceedings are commenced almost all cases settle without a court hearing taking place but please note that if ultimately there is a hearing, then you may need to attend court.
							</div>


							<li id="1_2">How we will deal with your claim</li>
							<div class="ppi-agreement-info" >
								Your claim will be dealt with by our experienced legal team, and Richard Gilbert, senior solicitor and our Head of Litigation, will have responsibility for the overall supervision of your claim.
								<br><br>
								For general enquiries and updates on your claim then you can speak to anyone in our legal team, who can be contacted by telephone on 0203 074 1100, or by email on team@ppisolicitors.co.uk
								<br><br>
								Our office is open between 9am to 5.30pm.
							</div>


							<li id="1_3">Communicating with you</li>
							<div class="ppi-agreement-info" >
								We will update you regularly (at least once a month), even if it just to let you know that the previous position remains unchanged, and we will always attempt to use plain language to explain the position. If you give us your email address, then all our written communications with you will be by e-mail, otherwise we will write to you at the address provided. We will progress your claim as quickly as possible, but we are required by the courts to give Defendants a reasonable time to reply and some Defendants will try to discourage claims by making it as hard as possible to claim and by deliberately causing delays, so please bear with us.
								<br><br>
								If the Defendant offers you Compensation that is less than the amount we believe you are entitled to receive, then we will contact you and advise you on whether that offer should be accepted. You are not obliged to accept that advice, and sections 2.4 and 2.6 below set out what happens if you do not wish to accept an offer which we believe is reasonable and should be accepted.
								<br><br>
								Throughout this document “Compensation” includes:
								<br><br>
								a)	any interest paid to you, or<br>
								b)	any monies paid directly to you by the Defendant or<br>
								c)	any liability you have to the Defendant (including interest) which the Defendant agrees to forego or not pursue.<br>
								<br>
								and “Defendant” includes any organisation with which the Defendant may be associated, or which is associated with this claim.
							</div>


							<li id="1_4">The service we provide</li>
							<div class="ppi-agreement-info" >
								We will be acting for you on a “No win, no fee” basis, i.e. normally we will only charge you our fees if your case ends successfully and you are paid Compensation but the details are set out in section 2 below.
								<br><br>

								A “Damages Based Agreement” (sections 2.3 and 2.4) will be in place from the beginning of your claim, but if you are forced to issue proceedings and the Defendant serves a defence, then this agreement will end and a “Conditional Fee Agreement” (sections 2.5 and 2.6) will take its place. The change between these 2 agreements will be automatic - there will be nothing for you to sign or do.
								<br><br>

								The agreements work in a very similar way to each other and the fees that apply under both agreements, are fully set out below in section 2.
								<br><br>

								The Damages Based Agreement (“DBA”) and an explanation of it, is at sections 2.3 and 2.4. The Conditional Fee Agreement (“CFA”) and an explanation of it, is at sections 2.5 and 2.6. The terms of those two documents form a contract between us and override anything in this information pack, so it is important that you read and understand sections 2.3 to 2.6 carefully. We will also where necessary arrange to purchase “After The Event” legal expense insurance policy (“ATE Insurance”) on your behalf if you do not already have such cover (see section 3.2). In this document we refer to all 3 items (the DBA, CFA and your ATE Insurance policy) as “Your Contract With Us”. If you have any queries about them, please do not hesitate to contact us.
								<br><br>

								The service we will provide to you will include the following:
								<br><br>

								•	We will review your claim regularly.<br>
								•	We will advise you of any changes in the law.<br>
								•	We will advise you of any circumstances and risks of which we are aware that could affect the outcome of your claim.<br>
								•	We will issue court proceedings on your behalf whenever necessary<br>
								<br>
								In return, you must:
								<br><br>
								•	Provide us where necessary with clear, prompt and accurate instructions.<br>
								•	Provide us with all documentation required to pursue your claim.<br>
								<br>
								Please also note that (as with all solicitor services) there is no legal requirement for you to be represented by a solicitor firm and you could yourself carry out all and any of the work involved in this claim.

							</div>


							<li id="1_5">Sending you your compensation</li>
							<div class="ppi-agreement-info" >
								By instructing us, you are specifically requiring and authorising us to receive your Compensation on your behalf. This is important because Defendants sometimes (wrongly) refuse to send the Compensation unless we are specifically authorised to receive it.
								<br><br>
								If you receive any offer, payment or communication from the Defendant, you must let us know immediately and not take any steps in relation to that communication until you have heard back from us. If you do not, there is a risk that you may accidentally prejudice your claim or make it impossible to pursue the Defendant in which event you will be liable to pay for that work and any legal costs which the Defendant is entitled to claim.
								<br><br>
								If we recover your Compensation, we will hold any money paid to us in our client account. We will then deduct our charges and send the Compensation to you as quickly as possible.
								<br><br>
								If a Defendant does not pay the Compensation to us, but instead sends us a cheque made payable to you, then we will not be obliged to send you that cheque until you have paid us Our Guaranteed Charges (defined in section 2.1 below).
								<br><br>
								If we have not received full payment of our Guaranteed Charges 14 days after we have notified you of the Guaranteed Charge then we will return the Compensation cheque to the Defendant and ask them to make payment directly to us.
								<br><br>
								If a Defendant pays any Compensation directly to you, then you will be liable to pay Our Guaranteed Charges. If we are advised by a Defendant that they have paid any Compensation directly to you, we will ask you to confirm whether or not you have received it. If you do not within 14 days tell us whether or not you have received it, then you will be liable to pay Our Guaranteed Charges calculated on the basis that the sum notified by the Defendant has been paid to you. If neither you nor the Defendant inform us of the sum you have received then you will be liable to pay Our Guaranteed Charges, based on our reasonable calculation of the damages interest and costs due to you.
								<br><br>
								We will pay you interest on your money if in the circumstances it is fair and reasonable to do so. Since the interest we can earn on this money is currently very low, and since we will normally only hold your money for a very short period, any interest will be extremely small. For that reason we will not pay you any interest on the money we temporarily hold for you in our client account unless the interest exceeds £20.
								<br><br>
								Where we pay money to you, we will ask you to provide your bank details in writing and will pay it to you by electronic bank transfer (BACS). Please note that we cannot send the money to someone other than yourself. It will not be paid in cash and payment by cheque or to an overseas bank will incur an extra charge (see section 2.1).

<!-- SPLIT -->

					<li> Our Charges
						<ol>
							<li id="2_1">“No Win, No Fee”</li>
							<div class="ppi-agreement-info" >
								We have agreed to act for you on a “No win, No fee” basis, under a “Damages Based Agreement” (section 2.3 below), from now until a defence is received from the Defendant, and under a “Conditional Fee Agreement” (section 2.5 below) once a defence is received.  Unless you breach Your Contract With Us, we will not charge you anything if you do not receive any Compensation under either of these agreements.
								<br><br>
								If you receive any Compensation, our charges are set out in 2.3 to 2.6, but due to legal requirements these agreements are quite complex and we therefore thought that it would be useful to summarise <b><u>the maximum you will ever pay</u></b>, which will only ever be one of the following :
								<br><br>
								<b>Stage 1 - If your case concludes successfully before court proceedings are issued
								<br><br>
								<u>Maximum Deduction</u></b>
								<br><br>
								15% plus VAT of the Compensation recovered from the Defendant, less any of our costs and disbursements which are paid by the Defendant.
								<br><br>

								<b>
								Stage 2   - If your case concludes successfully after proceedings are issued but before a defence is received
								<br><br>
								<u>
								Maximum Deduction</u></b>
								<br><br>
								a)	35% plus VAT of the Compensation recovered from the Defendant, less any of our costs which are paid by the Defendant; and<br>
								b)	any disbursement inc. VAT,(excluding barrister’s fees), which is not paid in full by the Defendant e.g. an expert’s report or court fee; and<br>
								c) 	the premium for a legal expenses insurance policy (see section 3.1)<br><br>

								The total deduction under a) and c) above will never exceed 49% of your Compensation<br><br>
								<b>
								Stage 3   - If your case concludes successfully after proceedings are issued and after a defence is received

								<u>Maximum Deduction</u></b><br><br>

								a)	35% plus VAT of the Compensation recovered from the Defendant; and<br>
								b)	any disbursement inc. VAT which is not paid in full by the Defendant e.g. an expert’s report, barrister’s fee or court fee; and<br>
								c) 	the premium for a legal expenses insurance policy (see section 3.1)<br><br>


								<b>Stage 4  - If your case concludes successfully after a final hearing date has been set by a court
								<br><br>
								<u>
								Maximum Deduction</u></b><br><br>

								The same charges as in Stage 3 above but the figure of 35% plus VAT in Stage 3 will instead be 40% plus VAT.<br><br>

								Details of exactly how our fees are calculated, including the credit you receive for all costs recovered from the Defendant, are set out sections 2.3 and 2.4 (DBA) and 2.5 and 2.6 (CFA). We will bill you for our charges when we send you your Compensation, and we will deduct those charges from the money we send you.<br><br>

								We do not make any separate charge for sending you your Compensation by electronic bank transfer to a UK bank but if you require a cheque, or need the money transferred to an overseas account, then we will incur additional bank charges, and we will therefore make an additional charge to you as follows:<br><br>

								Payment to you by cheque: £12 inclusive of VAT<br>
								Payment to a bank outside the UK: £20.40 inclusive of VAT<br><br>

								(in the rest of this  document we refer to our charges set out above in this section 2.1, as “Our Guaranteed Charges”).<br><br>


								<b>We confirm that</b> unless you breach Your Contract With Us,:<br><br>

								•	You will never pay more than our Guaranteed Charges.<br>
								•	If we do not recover any Compensation for you, then there will be nothing whatsoever for you to pay.<br>
								•	There will never be an outcome in which our charges exceed the Compensation we recover for you.<br><br>

								<b>NB.</b> We are also legally required to let you have an estimate of our charges, and we will notify you if our estimate changes. We estimate that if proceedings are issued and this matter proceeded to a final hearing, then our costs will be between £10,000 to £15,000, and that without proceedings, our costs will be around £2,500, but once again this formal notification has little relevance to you because unless you breach Your Contract With Us you will never have to pay us more than Our Guaranteed Charges.<br><br>


							</div>



							<li id="2_2">Your “Damages Based Agreement” and “Conditional Fee Agreement”</li>
							<div class="ppi-agreement-info" >
								Unfortunately these agreements are complicated by government regulations which require Our Guaranteed Charges to be contained in a mandatory form - a “No win, no fee” agreement called “Damages Based Agreement” and also where necessary a “Conditional Fee Agreement”.  These are formal legal agreements between us and contain various hourly rates and quite complicated provisions about maximum deductions etc. It is obviously important that you read these carefully, together with the documents “What You Need to Know …” (Sections 2.4 and 2.6) which explain how these agreements work, and when you can end them etc. but the essential point to note is that provided you do not breach Your Contract With Us then if you recover nothing, you pay us nothing, and if we recover your Compensation, <b>we will never charge you more than Our Guaranteed Charges.</b>


							</div>



							<li id="2_3">Damages Based Agreement</li>
							<div class="ppi-agreement-info" >


								<span style="">(Your “No Win, No Fee” Agreement)</span>
								<br><br>
								This agreement is a binding legal contract between you and your solicitor, PPI Solicitors (the trading name of FairPlane UK Limited). It comes into effect on the date you receive it but also covers any work we have carried out on your behalf since you instructed us. You should read this Agreement in conjunction with the “DBAs, What you need to know” document (section 2.4).<br><br>
								In this agreement, “We/Us” means, PPI Solicitors (the trading name of FairPlane UK Limited), and “You” means you the Client.<br><br>
								<b>What is covered by this agreement:</b><br>
								•	Your claim for Compensation and reimbursement of all losses arising out of you being sold or mis-sold personal protection insurance (PPI).<br>
								•	This agreement relates to all stages of first instance proceedings, including any pre-action disclosure application, until a defence is filed.<br>
								•	If a defence is filed defending the claim either in full or in part, then this agreement will come to an end<br><br>

								<b>What is not covered by this agreement?</b><br>
								•	Any proceedings you take to enforce a judgment, order or agreement.<br>
								•	Negotiations about and/or a court assessment of the costs of this claim.<br>
								•	Any appeal you make against the final judgment or order.<br>
								•	Any appeal by your opponent.<br><br>

								<b>Paying us if you win</b><br>
								We have agreed act on your behalf on a no win no fee basis and to waive our fees in the event that You lose your claim (see section “What do I pay if I lose?”), for which You have agreed to pay Us part of the total damages You are paid by the Defendant if You win. The amount that You have agreed to pay Us if You win your claim will depend on the stage at which your case concludes and is calculated as follows:
								<br><br>

								<b>EITHER:</b><br><br>

								<u>If your case concludes successfully before proceedings are issued</u><br><br>

								15% (plus VAT) of the total damages that the Defendant pays You (including the value of any other benefit received, e.g. a reduction of monies owed by You to the Defendant) in settlement of:  i) our fees; ii) all disbursements, including barrister’s fees; and iii) an ATE Insurance premium.<br><br>

								Less:  any costs, disbursements (including barrister’s fees) and VAT which are paid by the Defendant.<br><br>

								<b>OR</b><br><br>

								<u>If your case concludes successfully after proceedings are issued</u><br><br>

								a)	35% (plus VAT) of the total damages that the Defendant pays You (including the value of any other benefit received, e.g. a reduction of monies owed by You to the Defendant) in settlement of: i) our fees; and ii) barrister’s fees; and<br><br>

								b)	Our disbursements plus VAT (excluding barrister’s fees), e.g. expert’s report, Court fees, and<br><br>

								c)	the premium for any ATE Insurance policy<br><br>

								d)	Less: any of our costs, disbursements (including barrister’s fees) and VAT which are paid by the Defendant.<br><br>

								but the total of a) plus c) above will never exceed 49% of your Compensation.<br><br>


								<b>What do I pay if I lose?</b><br>
								If you lose, you may be liable to pay your opponents costs, disbursements and VAT, and you will be liable to pay our disbursements, but we are arranging an insurance policy for you (called an ATE legal expense insurance policy) which will cover this liability, so you will not be required to make any payment so long as you comply with the terms of the ATE legal expense insurance policy, details of which can be found in section 3.6 below (Claimsafe ATE – Insurance Policy Information Document).<br><br>

								If you lose, you do not pay our charges or VAT so long as you comply with the terms and conditions of this agreement (see the “DBAs, What you need to know” document below).
								<br><br>
								<b>Other points</b><br><br>

								The parties acknowledge and agree that this agreement is a damages based agreement within the terms of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, made pursuant to the Damages-Based Agreements Regulations 2013 ( Statutory Instrument 2013/609).<br><br>

								<b>Right to cancel your agreement</b><br><br>

								The Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 applies to our agreement with you.<br>

								You have the right to cancel this agreement within 14 days of receiving it without giving any reason.<br>

								The cancellation period will expire after 14 days of you receiving this agreement.<br>

								To exercise the right to cancel, you must inform us of your decision to cancel this contract by a clear statement (e.g. a letter sent by post or email) which should be sent to FairPlane UK Limited (t/a PPI Solicitors), 2nd Floor, Westgate House, Harlow, Essex CM20 1YS, or by email to claim@ppisolicitors.co.uk.<br>

								To meet your cancellation deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right to cancel before the cancellation period has expired.<br><br>

								<b>Effects of cancellation</b><br><br>

								If you cancel this agreement within the 14 days stipulated above we will reimburse to you all payments we have received from you, within 14 days after the day on which we are informed about your decision to cancel this contract.<br>

								We will make this reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise, in any event you will not incur any fees as a result of reimbursement.<br>

								If you requested us to begin the performance of services during the cancellation period, we will charge you only for the work which we have carried out until we receive your cancelation and any charges which have arisen during that period.<br><br>

							<li id="2_4">DBA's: What you need to know</li>
							<div class="ppi-agreement-info" >
								The definitions used in this document and the accompanying Damages Based Agreement (section 2.3) are explained at the end of this document.<br><br>
								<b>What do I pay if I win?</b><br><br>
								If you win your claim, you pay us part of the total damages you are paid by the Defendant. The amount that you pay is dependent on which stage your case settles and is calculated as follows:<br><br>

								<b>EITHER:</b><br><br>

								<u>If your case concludes successfully before proceedings are issued</u><br><br>

								15% (plus VAT) of the total damages that the Defendant pays You,<br>
								in settlement of:  i) our fees; ii) all disbursements, including barrister’s fees; and iii) an ATE Insurance premium.<br><br>

								less any costs and VAT which are paid by the Defendant.<br><br>

								<b>OR</b><br><br>

								<u>If your case concludes successfully after proceedings are issued</u><br><br>

								a)	35% (plus VAT) of the total damages that the Defendant pays You (including the value of any other benefit received, e.g. a reduction of monies owed by You to the Defendant; in settlement of i) our fees and ii) barrister’s fees (where relevant); and<br><br>

								b)	Our disbursements plus VAT (excluding barrister’s fees), e.g. expert’s report, Court fees; and<br><br>

								c)	the premium for a legal expenses insurance policy<br><br>

								d)	Less: any of our costs, disbursements (including barrister’s fees) and VAT which are paid by the Defendant.<br><br>

								but the total of a) plus c) above will never exceed 49% of your Compensation.<br><br>

								In this agreement we refer to all of the above as our <b>“Overall Charge”</b><br><br>
								If you win overall but on the way you lose an interim hearing, then you may be required to pay your opponent’s costs, disbursements and VAT of that hearing, but we are arranging an insurance policy (called an ATE legal expense insurance policy) for you which will cover this liability, so you will not be required to make payment so long as you comply with the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, details of which can be found in section 3.6 below (Claimsafe ATE – Insurance Policy Information Document).<br><br>
								If on the way to winning or losing you are awarded any costs, either by agreement or by court order, then we are entitled to payment of those costs immediately, but they will be taken into account for the purposes of calculating our Overall Charge if you go on to win.<br><br>
								<b>What do I pay if I lose?</b><br><br>
								If you lose, you may be liable to pay your opponents costs, disbursements and VAT, and you will be liable to pay our disbursements, but we are arranging an ATE legal expense insurance policy which will cover this liability.<br><br>

								So you will not be required to make any payment so long as you comply with the terms and conditions of the ATE legal expense insurance policy, details of which can be found in section 3.6 below (Claimsafe ATE – Insurance Policy Information Document).<br><br>

								If you lose, you do not pay our charges or VAT so long as you comply with the terms and conditions of this agreement.<br><br>

								<b>Value added tax (VAT)</b><br><br>
								We are required to add VAT to our fees, at the rate (currently 20%) that applies when our Overall Charge is calculated.<br><br>

						<ol >



							<li id="3_1">Insuring Against Losing</li>
							<div class="ppi-agreement-info" >
								Although we believe your claim is likely to succeed, we will be arranging insurance to cover you against the risk of you either losing your claim or having deductions made from the damages you recover. This sort of insurance is called After The Event insurance (“ATE Insurance”) and is necessary in order to protect you financially. As we have explained above, if your claim is unsuccessful you will not normally be liable for this firm’s costs, but there are a number of reasons why you need ATE Insurance:<br><br>
								a) If you lose your claim you <b>may have to pay our expenses</b> (called disbursements) i.e. what we may have to pay on your behalf for items such as an expert’s report, court fees and barrister’s fees for both advice and court appearances as necessary. These may run to many thousands of pounds - much will depend on what stage your case has reached, the value of your claim and whether the Defendant agrees to settle with you.<br><br>


								b) If you lose your claim, and proceedings have been issued then you will usually have to pay your opponent’s recoverable costs, disbursements and VAT (“the Defendant's Costs”).<br><br>

								How much costs you might be liable to pay for the Defendant’s Costs is very difficult to say at this point, as much will depend on when the case settles and whether your case is a small claim, a fast track claim or a multi-track claim. Claims with a value of less than £10,000 will usually be treated as a small claim, where costs are fixed and usually limited to only a few hundred pounds, but courts do have a discretion to allocate any claim to the fast track if they feel the case is too complicated to be dealt with as a small claim. Fast track costs will typically be many thousands of pounds by the time a case reaches trial, but any claim with a value of more than £25,000 will normally be treated as a multi-track claim where Defendant’s costs may be tens of thousands of pounds.<br><br>

								Explaining all of the circumstances in which you may have to pay the Defendant's Costs is quite complex, but a brief summary of the costs risks which necessitate ATE Insurance, is as follows:<br><br>

								i)	If your claim is unsuccessful then the normal rule is that the Defendant can recover from you the costs disbursements and VAT which they reasonably and necessarily incurred in defending your claim, but what you pay will be limited to relatively low fixed costs if the case is dealt with as a small claim.<br><br>

								ii)	Even if your claim is successful, you may have to pay some of the Defendant's Costs. The most likely circumstance where this would occur is if you “failed to beat the Defendant’s offer”. This would happen if the Defendant offered you Compensation which you refused to accept (normally because the offer seemed too low) but later in the case you were forced to accept that offer (or a lower offer) or the court awarded you the same amount as the Defendant had offered (or less). If you ended up with less than the Defendant had offered, then you would have to pay the Defendant's Costs from 21 days after their offer, until the end of the case. This could substantially reduce the net Compensation you received or if the costs awarded against you were greater than the Compensation you received, you would have a net overall liability to the Defendant even if your claim had been successful.<br><br>

								iii)	Another circumstance where you would normally be liable for costs is where (as part of the process leading to an eventual trial) you or the Defendant made an application to the court about anything concerning your case, and the court ruled in favour of the Defendant and (as is normal) then awarded costs against you.<br><br><br>


								If we need to instruct a barrister, having ATE insurance may (depending on the barrister arrangements) avoid you having to pay your barrister a “success fee” out of any Compensation you receive, and so may save you money even where your claim is successful.<br><br>
								Because of these risks and advantages, we strongly recommend that you should buy ATE Insurance to protect yourself. We recommend that you obtain a policy from Leeward Insurance Company Limited (“Leeward”) which we will purchase on your behalf to provide that protection.<br><br>
								The premium is £50 plus IPT if the case settles pre-issue, but we pay this out of our charges, so you will not have to pay this yourself. If the case settles after proceedings are issued, then a further £336.40 will be incurred (£386.40 in total). The price of the premium will not vary during the lifetime of your claim, but the government may change the rate of IPT from time to time which may increase the overall premium – IPT must be paid at the time when your premium is paid.<br><br>
								It is important to note that if a policy is purchased at a later point in your claim then the premium will be more expensive than above.  It is better to insure the claim at the outset to make sure that you have cover for all eventualities, such as if we need to issue proceedings or a formal offer is received, and to enable you to secure the cheapest premium.<br><br>
								The benefits of the policy (as well as its key terms and exclusions) are set out in the attached “Insurance Product Information Document” (section 3.6 below), but we would specifically mention:<br><br>
								•	You do not have to pay anything for this policy now.<br>
								•	If your claim is unsuccessful you do not have to pay for this policy.<br>
								•	If your claim is successful, the premium will be deducted from the damages you recover.<br>
								•	The policy gives you the ability to ensure that the Defendant pays you the correct level of damages because you can confidently reject a damages offer which is too low (if we advise you to) and if you later receive less than the sum you rejected, the policy will pay your liability for the Defendant's costs. This benefit alone may well outweigh the cost of the premium.<br><br>
								Unless you instruct us otherwise, we will arrange for a Leeward insurance policy to be taken out to protect you against the risks set out above. In doing so you will be agreeing to allow the insurer, our agents Box Legal Limited and our lenders, to inspect your file and receive ongoing information from us regarding the progress of your case and its outcome. You will also be agreeing with Leeward that we can act on your behalf to ensure that the policy terms are complied with and that any policy premium received  from the Defendant is held in trust for your insurers, until the premium is paid. Most importantly, your instructing us to proceed will constitute your irrevocable agreement to allow us to receive your damages and to deduct the appropriate premium from the damages and to send it to the insurer in settlement of the liability to pay the premium.<br><br>

								<b>PLEASE NOTE SECTION 5 BELOW WHICH SETS OUT OUR FINANCIAL INTEREST IN RECOMMENDING THIS PRODUCT.</b>
								<br>


							</div>




							<li id="3_2">Existing Insurance Policy </li>
							<div class="ppi-agreement-info" >
								Although unlikely, you may already have a legal expense insurance policy which will cover you for this claim, which would mean there may be no need for us to arrange a further policy for you.<br><br>

								You may have a stand-alone legal expense insurance policy in place, although more commonly legal expense insurance policies are offered and attached to other insurance products, such as your home or motor insurance policies, an insurance policy that was arranged with a credit card or through your bank account or travel insurance. Please also check whether any organisation (eg. a union) provides legal expenses cover.<br><br>

								We therefore ask you to please check all your insurance policies (or organisation membership terms) to see if any contain legal expense cover. If they do, it is possible that the cover is restricted to certain claim types only and there may be other conditions on when and how any case should be pursued, e.g. you may be required to instruct a new solicitor who is on that insurer’s panel.<br><br>

								We therefore suggest that you forward to us a copy of any legal expense policy (or membership terms) you discover, so that we can advise you on the terms of the policy and whether it is suitable for this case.<br><br>

							<div class="ppi-agreement-info" >
								Please note that Leeward Insurance Company Limited is incorporated in Bermuda and is regulated in Bermuda by the Bermuda Monetary Authority under the Bermuda Insurance Act 1978 as amended. Any transaction with Leeward Insurance Company Limited will not fall within any Compensation scheme, but you have the right to refer any dispute under the policy to the Isle of Man Financial Services Ombudsman in the Isle of Man. Alternatively, any dispute under the policy will be dealt with by an arbitrator appointed where necessary by the Law Society in accordance with the “Arbitration” section of the ClaimSafe policy. The policy is governed by English law. We have carefully considered the effect of this on your behalf, and we are satisfied that overall, taking into account all reasons which might lead to non-payment, there is a very low risk of non-payment of claims, and indeed this policy appears to be superior in this regard to many on the market. Please let us know if you would like further details.<br><br>
								Please also note that as with many insurance policies, our relationship with Leeward Insurance Company Limited is intended to be long-term and a high level of claims on the ClaimSafe policies which we take out for our clients may prejudice that relationship and eventually increase premiums or involve payments which this firm may be responsible for. If in the future the circumstances of your own case, materially conflicts with ours then we will recommend that Counsel’s advice should be obtained on those areas of conflict, for which the policy will pay any irrecoverable costs.<br><br>

						<ol >
							<li id="5_1">Referral fees/fee sharing</li>
							<div class="ppi-agreement-info" >
								We sometimes share up to 40% of the legal fees we deduct from your damages with an introducer of work. This does not increase our charges to you but is payment for marketing and for the referral of your claim to us.<br><br>
								If your claim was introduced to us by Ward Kemp Ltd then please note that our principal directors also own shares in Ward Kemp Ltd, and they will therefore derive a benefit from any referral fee which we pay to Ward Kemp Ltd.<br><br>
								Our referral fee arrangements vary from case by case, so please contact us if you require details of the referral fee applicable for your own claim.<br><br>

							</div>

							<li id="5_2">ATE legal expense insurance</li>
							<div class="ppi-agreement-info" >
								Please note that the broker of this policy is Box Legal Limited (“Box Legal”) which is owned by our principal directors. Box Legal does not receive any direct benefit or commission as a result of the policy recommended in section 3, but it is possible that it may in the future receive some indirect benefit from the policy’s insurer, although what type of benefit that may be, and the amount of it, is currently unknown.<br><br>

								Our principal directors also have an interest in Leeward Insurance Company Limited (“Leeward”) - the insurer of the policy recommended in section 3, and may receive a payment from Leeward in respect of Leeward’s annual profit, which will include Leeward’s profit (if any) on the premium for that policy. It is not possible to estimate the amount by which our directors will benefit from this policy (if at all), because any payment to them will depend on claim levels and Leeward’s overall profit in any year.<br><br>

								We are, however, confident that recommending this legal expense insurance product is nonetheless in your best interests, because it protects you against the financial risks of losing this claim and is at a cost which is competitive compared with the general ATE Insurance legal expense market.<br><br>
