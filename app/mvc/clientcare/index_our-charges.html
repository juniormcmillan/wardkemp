					<li> Our Charges
						<ol>
							<li id="2_1">“No Win, No Fee”</li>
							<div class="ppi-agreement-info" >
								We have agreed to act for you on a “No win, No fee” basis, under a “Damages Based Agreement” (section 2.3 below), from now until a defence is received from the Defendant, and under a “Conditional Fee Agreement” (section 2.5 below) once a defence is received.  Unless you breach Your Contract With Us, we will not charge you anything if you do not receive any Compensation under either of these agreements.
								<br><br>
								If you receive any Compensation, our charges are set out in 2.3 to 2.6, but due to legal requirements these agreements are quite complex and we therefore thought that it would be useful to summarise <b><u>the maximum you will ever pay</u></b>, which will only ever be one of the following :
								<br><br>
								<b>Stage 1 - If your case concludes successfully before court proceedings are issued
								<br><br>
								<u>Maximum Deduction</u></b>
								<br><br>
								15% plus VAT of the Compensation recovered from the Defendant, less any of our costs and disbursements which are paid by the Defendant.
								<br><br>

								<b>
								Stage 2   - If your case concludes successfully after proceedings are issued but before a defence is received
								<br><br>
								<u>
								Maximum Deduction</u></b>
								<br><br>
								a)	35% plus VAT of the Compensation recovered from the Defendant, less any of our costs which are paid by the Defendant; and<br>
								b)	any disbursement inc. VAT,(excluding barrister’s fees), which is not paid in full by the Defendant e.g. an expert’s report or court fee; and<br>
								c) 	the premium for a legal expenses insurance policy (see section 3.1)<br><br>

								The total deduction under a) and c) above will never exceed 49% of your Compensation<br><br>
								<b>
								Stage 3   - If your case concludes successfully after proceedings are issued and after a defence is received

								<u>Maximum Deduction</u></b><br><br>

								a)	35% plus VAT of the Compensation recovered from the Defendant; and<br>
								b)	any disbursement inc. VAT which is not paid in full by the Defendant e.g. an expert’s report, barrister’s fee or court fee; and<br>
								c) 	the premium for a legal expenses insurance policy (see section 3.1)<br><br>


								<b>Stage 4  - If your case concludes successfully after a final hearing date has been set by a court
								<br><br>
								<u>
								Maximum Deduction</u></b><br><br>

								The same charges as in Stage 3 above but the figure of 35% plus VAT in Stage 3 will instead be 40% plus VAT.<br><br>

								Details of exactly how our fees are calculated, including the credit you receive for all costs recovered from the Defendant, are set out sections 2.3 and 2.4 (DBA) and 2.5 and 2.6 (CFA). We will bill you for our charges when we send you your Compensation, and we will deduct those charges from the money we send you.<br><br>

								We do not make any separate charge for sending you your Compensation by electronic bank transfer to a UK bank but if you require a cheque, or need the money transferred to an overseas account, then we will incur additional bank charges, and we will therefore make an additional charge to you as follows:<br><br>

								Payment to you by cheque: £12 inclusive of VAT<br>
								Payment to a bank outside the UK: £20.40 inclusive of VAT<br><br>

								(in the rest of this  document we refer to our charges set out above in this section 2.1, as “Our Guaranteed Charges”).<br><br>


								<b>We confirm that</b> unless you breach Your Contract With Us,:<br><br>

								•	You will never pay more than our Guaranteed Charges.<br>
								•	If we do not recover any Compensation for you, then there will be nothing whatsoever for you to pay.<br>
								•	There will never be an outcome in which our charges exceed the Compensation we recover for you.<br><br>

								<b>NB.</b> We are also legally required to let you have an estimate of our charges, and we will notify you if our estimate changes. We estimate that if proceedings are issued and this matter proceeded to a final hearing, then our costs will be between £10,000 to £15,000, and that without proceedings, our costs will be around £2,500, but once again this formal notification has little relevance to you because unless you breach Your Contract With Us you will never have to pay us more than Our Guaranteed Charges.<br><br>


							</div>



							<li id="2_2">Your “Damages Based Agreement” and “Conditional Fee Agreement”</li>
							<div class="ppi-agreement-info" >
								Unfortunately these agreements are complicated by government regulations which require Our Guaranteed Charges to be contained in a mandatory form - a “No win, no fee” agreement called “Damages Based Agreement” and also where necessary a “Conditional Fee Agreement”.  These are formal legal agreements between us and contain various hourly rates and quite complicated provisions about maximum deductions etc. It is obviously important that you read these carefully, together with the documents “What You Need to Know …” (Sections 2.4 and 2.6) which explain how these agreements work, and when you can end them etc. but the essential point to note is that provided you do not breach Your Contract With Us then if you recover nothing, you pay us nothing, and if we recover your Compensation, <b>we will never charge you more than Our Guaranteed Charges.</b>

							<li id="2_3">Damages Based Agreement</li>

								<span style="">(Your “No Win, No Fee” Agreement)</span>
								<br><br>
								This agreement is a binding legal contract between you and your solicitor, PPI Solicitors (the trading name of FairPlane UK Limited). It comes into effect on the date you receive it but also covers any work we have carried out on your behalf since you instructed us. You should read this Agreement in conjunction with the “DBAs, What you need to know” document (section 2.4).<br><br>
								In this agreement, “We/Us” means, PPI Solicitors (the trading name of FairPlane UK Limited), and “You” means you the Client.<br><br>
								<b>What is covered by this agreement:</b><br>
								•	Your claim for Compensation and reimbursement of all losses arising out of you being sold or mis-sold personal protection insurance (PPI).<br>
								•	This agreement relates to all stages of first instance proceedings, including any pre-action disclosure application, until a defence is filed.<br>
								•	If a defence is filed defending the claim either in full or in part, then this agreement will come to an end<br><br>

								<b>What is not covered by this agreement?</b><br>
								•	Any proceedings you take to enforce a judgment, order or agreement.<br>
								•	Negotiations about and/or a court assessment of the costs of this claim.<br>
								•	Any appeal you make against the final judgment or order.<br>
								•	Any appeal by your opponent.<br><br>

								<b>Paying us if you win</b><br>
								We have agreed act on your behalf on a no win no fee basis and to waive our fees in the event that You lose your claim (see section “What do I pay if I lose?”), for which You have agreed to pay Us part of the total damages You are paid by the Defendant if You win. The amount that You have agreed to pay Us if You win your claim will depend on the stage at which your case concludes and is calculated as follows:
								<br><br>

								<b>EITHER:</b><br><br>

								<u>If your case concludes successfully before proceedings are issued</u><br><br>

								15% (plus VAT) of the total damages that the Defendant pays You (including the value of any other benefit received, e.g. a reduction of monies owed by You to the Defendant) in settlement of:  i) our fees; ii) all disbursements, including barrister’s fees; and iii) an ATE Insurance premium.<br><br>

								Less:  any costs, disbursements (including barrister’s fees) and VAT which are paid by the Defendant.<br><br>

								<b>OR</b><br><br>

								<u>If your case concludes successfully after proceedings are issued</u><br><br>

								a)	35% (plus VAT) of the total damages that the Defendant pays You (including the value of any other benefit received, e.g. a reduction of monies owed by You to the Defendant) in settlement of: i) our fees; and ii) barrister’s fees; and<br><br>

								b)	Our disbursements plus VAT (excluding barrister’s fees), e.g. expert’s report, Court fees, and<br><br>

								c)	the premium for any ATE Insurance policy<br><br>

								d)	Less: any of our costs, disbursements (including barrister’s fees) and VAT which are paid by the Defendant.<br><br>

								but the total of a) plus c) above will never exceed 49% of your Compensation.<br><br>


								<b>What do I pay if I lose?</b><br>
								If you lose, you may be liable to pay your opponents costs, disbursements and VAT, and you will be liable to pay our disbursements, but we are arranging an insurance policy for you (called an ATE legal expense insurance policy) which will cover this liability, so you will not be required to make any payment so long as you comply with the terms of the ATE legal expense insurance policy, details of which can be found in section 3.6 below (Claimsafe ATE – Insurance Policy Information Document).<br><br>

								If you lose, you do not pay our charges or VAT so long as you comply with the terms and conditions of this agreement (see the “DBAs, What you need to know” document below).
								<br><br>
								<b>Other points</b><br><br>

							<li id="2_4">DBA's: What you need to know</li>
							<div class="ppi-agreement-info" >
								The definitions used in this document and the accompanying Damages Based Agreement (section 2.3) are explained at the end of this document.<br><br>
								<b>What do I pay if I win?</b><br><br>
								If you win your claim, you pay us part of the total damages you are paid by the Defendant. The amount that you pay is dependent on which stage your case settles and is calculated as follows:<br><br>

								<b>EITHER:</b><br><br>

								<u>If your case concludes successfully before proceedings are issued</u><br><br>

								15% (plus VAT) of the total damages that the Defendant pays You,<br>
								in settlement of:  i) our fees; ii) all disbursements, including barrister’s fees; and iii) an ATE Insurance premium.<br><br>

								less any costs and VAT which are paid by the Defendant.<br><br>

								<b>OR</b><br><br>

								<u>If your case concludes successfully after proceedings are issued</u><br><br>

								a)	35% (plus VAT) of the total damages that the Defendant pays You (including the value of any other benefit received, e.g. a reduction of monies owed by You to the Defendant; in settlement of i) our fees and ii) barrister’s fees (where relevant); and<br><br>

								b)	Our disbursements plus VAT (excluding barrister’s fees), e.g. expert’s report, Court fees; and<br><br>

								c)	the premium for a legal expenses insurance policy<br><br>

								d)	Less: any of our costs, disbursements (including barrister’s fees) and VAT which are paid by the Defendant.<br><br>

								but the total of a) plus c) above will never exceed 49% of your Compensation.<br><br>

								In this agreement we refer to all of the above as our <b>“Overall Charge”</b><br><br>
								If you win overall but on the way you lose an interim hearing, then you may be required to pay your opponent’s costs, disbursements and VAT of that hearing, but we are arranging an insurance policy (called an ATE legal expense insurance policy) for you which will cover this liability, so you will not be required to make payment so long as you comply with the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, details of which can be found in section 3.6 below (Claimsafe ATE – Insurance Policy Information Document).<br><br>
								If on the way to winning or losing you are awarded any costs, either by agreement or by court order, then we are entitled to payment of those costs immediately, but they will be taken into account for the purposes of calculating our Overall Charge if you go on to win.<br><br>
								<b>What do I pay if I lose?</b><br><br>
								If you lose, you may be liable to pay your opponents costs, disbursements and VAT, and you will be liable to pay our disbursements, but we are arranging an ATE legal expense insurance policy which will cover this liability.<br><br>

								So you will not be required to make any payment so long as you comply with the terms and conditions of the ATE legal expense insurance policy, details of which can be found in section 3.6 below (Claimsafe ATE – Insurance Policy Information Document).<br><br>

								If you lose, you do not pay our charges or VAT so long as you comply with the terms and conditions of this agreement.<br><br>

								<b>Value added tax (VAT)</b><br><br>
								We are required to add VAT to our fees, at the rate (currently 20%) that applies when our Overall Charge is calculated.<br><br>
								<b>Ending this agreement</b><br><br>
								If you end this agreement (after the first 14 days) before you win or lose, you must pay our disbursements incurred up to the date you end this agreement and our Overall Charge (less disbursements already paid) if you go on to win the claim.<br><br>
								We may end this agreement before you win or lose.<br><br>
								<b>Terms and conditions</b><br><br>
								The terms and conditions below are part of this agreement. You should read the conditions carefully and ask us about anything you find unclear.<br><br>
								<b>Our responsibilities</b><br><br>

								<b>Dealing with costs if you win</b><br><br>
								Normally you can claim our charges, disbursements and VAT from your opponent, and if we or your opponent cannot agree the amount, the Court will decide how much you can recover. All costs and disbursements recovered during your claim will where appropriate be taken into account when calculating your Overall Charge.<br><br>

								You agree to pay into a designated account any cheque or payment received by you from your opponent and made payable to you.  Out of that money you agree to let us take our Overall Charge, which you will hold in trust for us. You take the rest.<br><br>

								<b>If your opponent fails to pay</b><br><br>
								If your opponent does not pay any damages or charges owed to you, we have the right to take recovery action in your name to enforce a judgment, order or agreement.<br><br>
								<b>What happens when this agreement ends before your claim for damages ends?</b><br><br>
								(a)	Paying us if you end this agreement after the first 14 days<br><br>

								You can end the agreement at any time, however you must then:<br>
								•	Immediately pay all the disbursements incurred up to the date you end this agreement; and<br>
								•	Pay our Overall Charge if you go on to win your claim (less any disbursements already paid).<br><br>

								(b) Paying us if we end this agreement after the first 14 days<br><br>
								We can end this agreement if you do not keep to your responsibilities, in which case you must then:<br>
								•	Immediately pay all the disbursements incurred up to the date we end this agreement; and<br>
								•	Pay our Overall Charge if you go on to win your claim (less any disbursements already paid).<br><br>

								We can end this agreement if we believe you are unlikely to win. If this happens, you will not have to pay us anything, so you long as you have at all times complied with the terms and conditions of the ATE legal expense insurance policy and this agreement.<br><br>
								We can end this agreement if you reject our opinion about making a settlement with your opponent. You must then:<br>
								•	Pay our Overall Charge calculated on the basis of the settlement with your opponent that we have recommended, but you have rejected;<br><br>

								If you ask us to get a second opinion from a specialist solicitor or barrister outside our firm, we will do so. You pay the cost of a second opinion.<br><br>
								We can end this agreement if you become insolvent by reason of bankruptcy, entering into a voluntary arrangement or howsoever.  You must then pay our Overall Charge.<br><br>
								(c) Death<br><br>
								This agreement automatically ends if you die before your claim is concluded. We will be entitled to recover from your estate our disbursements incurred up to the date of your death.<br>
								If your personal representatives wish to continue your claim, we may offer them a new Damages Based Agreement.<br><br>
								<b>What happens after this agreement ends?</b><br><br>
								After this agreement ends, we may apply to have our name removed from the record of any court proceedings in which we are acting unless we are continuing to act for you under a new agreement, e.g. a Conditional Fee Agreement.<br>
								We have the right to preserve our lien unless another solicitor working for you undertakes to pay us what we are owed if you win.<br><br>

								If you lose, you do not pay our charges or VAT so long as you comply with the terms and conditions of this agreement (see the “CFAs, What you need to know” document below).<br><br>

							<li id="2_6">CFA's: What you need to know<li>
							<div class="ppi-agreement-info" >
								This document is a version recommended by the Law Society, but modified by us to suit the individual circumstances of your claim. The definitions used in this document and the accompanying Conditional Fee Agreement (section 2.5) are explained at the end of this document.<br><br>
								<b>What do I pay if I win?</b><br><br>
								If you win your claim, you pay us our charges, our disbursements and VAT and a success fee (plus VAT) together with the premium for the ATE insurance policy we are arranging on your behalf. You may be able to entitled to seek recovery from your opponent of part or all of our charges, disbursements and VAT, but not the success fee or ATE insurance premium.<br><br>

								Our charge to you is limited in any event to whatever costs, disbursements and VAT we can recover from the Defendant on your behalf, plus:<br><br>

								<b>EITHER:</b><br><br>

								<u>If your case concludes successfully before a final hearing date has been set by a court</u><br><br>


								a)	35% plus VAT of the Compensation recovered from the Defendant; and<br>
								b) 	any disbursement inc. VAT which is not paid in full by the Defendant e.g. an expert’s report, barrister’s fee or court fee; and<br>
								c) 	the premium for a legal expenses insurance policy (section 3.1)<br>
								d) 	The following bank charges:<br>
								Payment to you by cheque: £12 inclusive of VAT.<br>
								Payment to a bank outside the UK: £20.40 inclusive of VAT<br><br>
								<b>OR</b><br><br>

								<u>If your case concludes successfully after a final hearing date has been set by a court</u><br><br>

								a) 	40% plus VAT of the Compensation recovered from the Defendant; and<br>
								b) 	any disbursement inc. VAT which is not paid in full by the Defendant e.g. an expert’s report, barrister’s fee or court fee; and<br>
								c) 	the premium for a legal expenses insurance policy (section 3.1)<br>
								d) 	The following bank charges:<br>
								Payment to you by cheque: £12 inclusive of VAT.<br>
								Payment to a bank outside the UK: £20.40 inclusive of VAT<br><br>

								In this agreement we refer to all of the above as our <b>“Overall Charge”.</b><br>
								If you win overall but on the way you lose an interim hearing, then you may be required to pay your opponent’s costs, disbursements and VAT of that hearing, but we are arranging an insurance policy (called an ATE legal expense insurance policy) for you which will cover this liability. So you will not be required to make payment so long as you comply with the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, details of which can be found in section 3.6 below (Claimsafe ATE – Insurance Policy Information Document).<br><br>
								<b>What do I pay if I lose?</b><br><br>
								If you lose, you may be liable to pay your opponents costs, disbursements and VAT, and you will be liable to pay our disbursements, but we are arranging an insurance policy for you (called an ATE legal expense insurance policy) which will cover this liability.<br><br>

								So you will not be required to make any payment so long as you comply with the terms of the ATE legal expense insurance policy, details of which can be found in the section 3.6 below (Claimsafe ATE – Insurance Policy Information Document).<br><br>

								If you lose, you do not pay our charges or VAT so long as you comply with the terms and conditions of this agreement (see the “CFAs, What you need to know” document below).<br><br>

								<b>Ending this agreement</b><br><br>
								If you end this agreement before you win or lose, you must pay our Overall Charge<br><br>
								We may end this agreement before you win or lose.<br><br>
								<b>Success Fee</b><br><br>
								The success fee is set at 100% of our basic charges, where the claim concludes at trial or final hearing; or 25% of our basic charges where the claim concludes before a trial has commenced.<br><br>
								The success fee percentage reflects the following:<br><br>
								a)	the Defendant has filed a defence defending either all or part of your claim;<br>
								b)	the fact that if you lose, we will not earn anything;<br>
								c)	our assessment of the risks of your case;<br>
								d)	Any other appropriate matter;<br>
								e)	the fact that if you win we will not be paid our basic charges until the end of the claim;<br>
								f)	our arrangements with you about paying our expenses and disbursements;<br>
								g)	the arrangements about payment of our costs if your opponent makes a Part 36 offer or payment which you reject on our advice, but you subsequently recover damages that are less than that offer or payment.<br><br>

								<b>Our charges</b><br><br>
								These are for work done from when we were first instructed until this agreement ends. They are subject to review.  This agreement retrospectively covers work done prior to the Conditional Fee Agreement coming into effect.  These charges are subject to annual review.<br><br>
								<b>How we calculate our charges</b><br><br>
								These are calculated for each hour engaged on your matter. Routine letters and telephone calls will be charged as units of one tenth of an hour. Other letters and telephone calls will be charged on a time basis. The hourly rate which applies is £250.00 per hour plus VAT, and £350 per hour plus VAT in relation to any appeal.  We review the hourly rate on the 10th January each year, and we will notify you in writing of any change in the rate.<br><br>
								<b>Value added tax (VAT)</b><br><br>
								We add VAT, at the rate (now 20%) that applies when the work is done, to the total of the charges.<br>
								<b>Law Society Conditions</b><br><br>
								The Law Society Conditions below are part of this agreement. Any amendments or additions to them will apply to you. You should read the conditions carefully and ask us about anything you find unclear.<br><br>
								<b>Our responsibilities</b><br>

								•	Not instruct other solicitors or any other organisation to act in this claim while we are still acting, or instruct us if other solicitors or any other organisation is already acting in this claim.<br><br>


								<b>Dealing with costs if you win</b><br>
								Normally you can claim our charges, disbursements and VAT from your opponent, but not our success fee or the ATE insurance premium, and if we or your opponent cannot agree the amount, the Court will decide how much you can recover.<br><br>

								You are liable to pay:<br><br>

								•	our charges<br>
								•	disbursements<br>
								•	success fee<br>
								•	VAT<br>
								•	ATE insurance premium<br><br>

								Our charge to you however is limited in any event to whatever costs, disbursements and VAT we can recover from the Defendant on your behalf, plus:<br><br>

								<b>EITHER:</b><br><br>

								<u>If your case concludes successfully before a final hearing date has been set by a court</u><br><br>

								a) 	35% plus VAT of the Compensation recovered from the Defendant; and<br>
								b) 	any disbursement inc. VAT which is not paid in full by the Defendant e.g. an expert’s report, barrister’s fee or court fee; and<br>

								d) 	The following bank charges:<br>
								Payment to you by cheque: £12 inclusive of VAT.<br>

								d) 	The following bank charges:<br>
								Payment to you by cheque: £12 inclusive of VAT.<br>
								Payment to a bank outside the UK: £20.40 inclusive of VAT<br><br>


								At the conclusion of the claim we will provide you with a copy of our bill setting our Overall Charge, which will include details of all charges, disbursements and VAT paid by the Defendant.<br><br>

								You have the right to apply to the court for assessment of our costs, including our success fee.<br><br>

								You agree to pay into a designated account any cheque or payment received by you from your opponent and made payable to you.  Out of that money you agree to let us take our Overall Charge, which you will hold in trust for us. You take the rest.<br><br>

								We are allowed to keep any interest your opponent pays in relation to our charges.<br><br>
								<b>If your opponent fails to pay</b><br>
								If your opponent does not pay any damages or charges owed to you, we have the right to take recovery action in your name to enforce a judgment, order or agreement. The charges of this action become part of the charges.<br><br>
								<b>Payment for advocacy</b><br>
								The cost of advocacy and any other work by us, or by any solicitor agent on our behalf forms part of our charges. We shall discuss with you the identity of any barrister instructed, and the arrangements made for payment.<br><br>
								<b>Barristers who have a Conditional Fee Agreement with us</b><br>
								If you win, you are normally entitled to recover their fee from your opponent. The barrister's success fee is shown in the separate Conditional Fee Agreement we make with the barrister. We will discuss the barrister’s success fee with you before we instruct him or her. If you lose, you pay the barrister nothing.<br><br>
								<b>Barristers who do not have a Conditional Fee Agreement with us</b><br>
								If you win, then you will normally be entitled to recover all or part of their fee from your opponent.<br><br>

								If you lose the barrister’s fee will be covered by your ATE insurance policy and you will not be required to make any payment so long as you comply with the terms of the ATE legal expense insurance policy, details of which can be found in section 3.6 (Claimsafe ATE – Insurance Policy Information Document).<br><br>

								<b>What happens when this agreement ends before your claim for damages ends?</b><br><br>

								(c) Death<br><br>

								If your personal representatives wish to continue your claim, we may offer them a new Conditional Fee Agreement, as long as they agree to pay our charges from the beginning of the agreement with you.<br><br>

								After this agreement ends, we may apply to have our name removed from the record of any court proceedings in which we are acting unless you have another form of funding and ask us to work for you.<br><br>
