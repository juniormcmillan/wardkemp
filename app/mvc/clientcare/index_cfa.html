			<h2 class="text-center">CONDITIONAL FEE AGREEMENT WITH DRISCOLL KINGSTON</h2>

			<span class="ppi-bold">Your Name:</span> {{full_name}}<br><br>

			<span class="ppi-bold">Address:</span> {{address}}<br><br>


			This agreement is a binding legal contract between you and your solicitor/s. Before you sign, please read everything carefully. This agreement must be read in conjunction with the Schedules and the Law Society Conditions attached.
<br><br><br>
			<span class="ppi-bold">We, Driscoll Kingston Solicitors, hereinafter called “the solicitors”<br><br>
				You, <span style="text-decoration:underline;text-decoration-style:dotted; text-underline-position: under;margin:20px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{{full_name}}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><br>
			What is covered by this agreement</span><br><br>

			<ul>
			<li>
				Your claim for damages for housing disrepair at the above premises
			</li>
			</ul><br>
			<span class="ppi-bold">Any application for pre-action or non-party disclosure.</span><br><br>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Any appeal by your opponent.
				</li>
				<li>
					Any appeal you make against an interim order or an assessment of costs.
				</li>
				<li>
					Any proceedings you take to enforce a judgment, order or agreement.
				</li>
				<li>
					Negotiations about and/or a court assessment of the costs of this claim.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<span class="ppi-bold">What is not covered by this agreement</span>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Any counterclaim against you.
				</li>
				<li>
					Any appeal you make against the final judgment or order.
				</li>
			</ul><br>
			<span class="ppi-bold">Paying us if you win</span><br>
			If you win your claim, you pay our basic charges, our expenses and disbursements and a success fee together with the premium for any insurance you take out. You are entitled to seek recovery from your opponent of part or all of our basic charges and our expenses and disbursements, but not the success fee or any insurance premium.<br><br>
			<b>*The overall amount we will charge you for our basic charges, success fees, expenses and disbursements is limited as set out in Schedule 2 below.*</b><br><br>

			<br>

			It may be that your opponent makes a formal offer to settle your claim which you reject on our advice, and your claim for damages goes ahead to trial where you recover damages that are less than that offer. If this happens, we will not add our success fee to the basic charges for the work done after we received notice of the offer or payment. In these circumstances, you may be ordered to pay your opponent’s costs, but only up to the amount of damages and interest awarded to you.
			<br><br>
			<span class="ppi-bold">Expenses and Disbursements</span>
			<br><br>
			If you receive interim damages, we may require you to pay our expenses and disbursements at that point and a reasonable amount for our future expenses and disbursements.
			<br><br>
			If you receive provisional damages, we are entitled to payment of our basic charges, our expenses and disbursements and success fee at that point.
			<br><br>
			If you win overall but on the way lose an interim hearing, you may be required to pay your opponent’s charges of that hearing, but usually only up to the amount of damages awarded to you.
			<br><br>
			If on the way to winning or losing you are awarded any costs, by agreement or court order, then we are entitled to payment of those costs, together with a success fee on those charges if you win overall.
			<br><br>
			<span class="ppi-bold">What do I pay if I lose?</span><br><br>
			We are arranging an After the Event Insurance policy on your behalf which will cover your legal costs in the event your case is lost, unless:
			<br>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>
					the proceedings have been struck out; or
				</li>
				<li>
					the claim is fundamentally dishonest; or
				</li>
				<li>
					the claim includes a claim for the financial benefit of someone else.
				</li>
			</ul>
			If you lose, you do not pay our charges but we may require you to pay our expenses and disbursements.
			<br><br>
			If your claim is found to be fraudulent or fundamentally dishonest then you will pay our basic charges, expenses and disbursements.
			<br><br>
			<span class="ppi-bold">The Success Fee</span>
			The success fee is set out in Schedule 1.
			<br><br>
			<span class="ppi-bold">Basic Charges</span>
			Details of our basic charges are set out in Schedule 2.
			<br><br>
			<span class="ppi-bold">Ending this agreement</span>
			If you have a right to cancel this agreement under Schedule 3 (see below) and do so within the 7 day time limit, you will pay nothing. Otherwise if you end this agreement before you win or lose, you pay our basic charges and expenses and disbursements. If you go on to win, you also pay a success fee.
			We may end this agreement before you win or lose, with the consequences set out in the Law Society Condition
			<br><br>

			<span class="ppi-bold">Other points</span>
			Definitions of words used in this CFA are explained in the Law Society Conditions.<br><br>
			You have the right to cancel this agreement in the circumstances set out in Schedule 3.<br><br>
			We add VAT, at the rate that applies when the work is done, to the total of the basic charges and success fee. Our VAT Registration Number is 110164475.
			<br><br>
			<span class="ppi-bold">You may be able to take out an insurance policy against the risk of paying expenses and disbursements if you lose, or some or all of your opponent’s costs even if you win. You will be responsible for paying the insurance premium for this if you win. If you lose the premium is not payable. Full details are contained in the insurance policy documents. We will give further information about insurance policies to you so that you can decide whether you wish to take one out.</span>
			<br>
			The parties acknowledge and agree that this agreement is not a Contentious Business Agreement within the terms of the Solicitors Act 1974.<br><br>
			<span class="ppi-bold">Note: We are not bound to act on a conditional fee basis until both you and we have signed this agreement.</span>



			<br><br>
			<span class="ppi-bold">Schedule 1</span><br>
			<span class="ppi-bold">Success fee</span><br><br>


			The success fee is set at 100% of our basic charges, where the claim concludes
			at trial; or 100% where the claim concludes before a trial has commenced.<br><br>

			The success fee percentage reflects the following:<br><br>
			<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; ">
				<li>the fact that if you lose, we will not earn anything;
				</li>
				<li>our assessment of the risks of your case;
				</li>
				<li>any other appropriate matters;
				</li>
				<li>the fact that if you win we will not be paid our basic charges until the end of the claim;
				</li>
				<li>our arrangements with you about paying expenses and disbursements.
				</li>
				<li>the arrangements about payment of our costs if your opponent makes a Part 36 offer or payment which you reject on our advice, and your claim for damages goes ahead to trial where you recover damages that are less than that offer or payment.
				</li>
			</ol><br>
			The Success Fee cannot be more than 100% of the basic charges in total.<br><br>
			<span style="text-decoration:underline;">You also have the right to apply to the court for assessment of our costs, including  our success fee.</span>
