			<span class="ppi-bold">Your Name:</span> {{full_name}}<br><br>

			<span class="ppi-bold">Address:</span> {{address}}<br><br>


			This agreement is a binding legal contract between you and your solicitor/s. Before you sign, please read everything carefully. This agreement must be read in conjunction with the Schedules and the Law Society Conditions attached.
<br><br><br>
			<span class="ppi-bold">We, {{company_name}}, hereinafter called “the solicitors”<br><br>
				You, <span style="text-decoration:underline;text-decoration-style:dotted; text-underline-position: under;margin:20px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{{full_name}}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><br>
			What is covered by this agreement</span><br><br>

			<ul>
			<li>
				Your claim for damages for housing disrepair at the above premises
			</li>
			</ul><br>
			<span class="ppi-bold">Any application for pre-action or non-party disclosure.</span><br><br>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Any appeal by your opponent.
				</li>
				<li>
					Any appeal you make against an interim order or an assessment of costs.
				</li>
				<li>
					Any proceedings you take to enforce a judgment, order or agreement.
				</li>
				<li>
					Negotiations about and/or a court assessment of the costs of this claim.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<span class="ppi-bold">What is not covered by this agreement</span>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Any counterclaim against you.
				</li>
				<li>
					Any appeal you make against the final judgment or order.
				</li>
			</ul><br>
			<span class="ppi-bold">Paying us if you win</span><br>
			If you win your claim, you pay our basic charges, our expenses and disbursements and a success fee together with the premium for any insurance you take out. You are entitled to seek recovery from your opponent of part or all of our basic charges and our expenses and disbursements, but not the success fee or any insurance premium.<br><br>
			<b>*The overall amount we will charge you for our basic charges, success fees, expenses and disbursements is limited as set out in Schedule 2 below.*</b><br><br>

			<br>

			It may be that your opponent makes a formal offer to settle your claim which you reject on our advice, and your claim for damages goes ahead to trial where you recover damages that are less than that offer. If this happens, we will not add our success fee to the basic charges for the work done after we received notice of the offer or payment. In these circumstances, you may be ordered to pay your opponent’s costs, but only up to the amount of damages and interest awarded to you.
			<br><br>
			<span class="ppi-bold">Expenses and Disbursements</span>
			<br><br>
			If you receive interim damages, we may require you to pay our expenses and disbursements at that point and a reasonable amount for our future expenses and disbursements.
			<br><br>
			If you receive provisional damages, we are entitled to payment of our basic charges, our expenses and disbursements and success fee at that point.
			<br><br>
			If you win overall but on the way lose an interim hearing, you may be required to pay your opponent’s charges of that hearing, but usually only up to the amount of damages awarded to you.
			<br><br>
			If on the way to winning or losing you are awarded any costs, by agreement or court order, then we are entitled to payment of those costs, together with a success fee on those charges if you win overall.
			<br><br>
			<span class="ppi-bold">What do I pay if I lose?</span><br><br>
			We are arranging an After the Event Insurance policy on your behalf which will cover your legal costs in the event your case is lost, unless:
			<br>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>
					the proceedings have been struck out; or
				</li>
				<li>
					the claim is fundamentally dishonest; or
				</li>
				<li>
					the claim includes a claim for the financial benefit of someone else.
				</li>
			</ul>
			If you lose, you do not pay our charges but we may require you to pay our expenses and disbursements.
			<br><br>
			If your claim is found to be fraudulent or fundamentally dishonest then you will pay our basic charges, expenses and disbursements.
			<br><br>
			<span class="ppi-bold">The Success Fee</span>
			The success fee is set out in Schedule 1.
			<br><br>
			<span class="ppi-bold">Basic Charges</span>
			Details of our basic charges are set out in Schedule 2.
			<br><br>
			<span class="ppi-bold">Ending this agreement</span>
			If you have a right to cancel this agreement under Schedule 3 (see below) and do so within the 7 day time limit, you will pay nothing. Otherwise if you end this agreement before you win or lose, you pay our basic charges and expenses and disbursements. If you go on to win, you also pay a success fee.
			We may end this agreement before you win or lose, with the consequences set out in the Law Society Condition
			<br><br>

			<span class="ppi-bold">Other points</span>
			Definitions of words used in this CFA are explained in the Law Society Conditions.<br><br>
			You have the right to cancel this agreement in the circumstances set out in Schedule 3.<br><br>
			We add VAT, at the rate that applies when the work is done, to the total of the basic charges and success fee. Our VAT Registration Number is 110164475.
			<br><br>
			<span class="ppi-bold">You may be able to take out an insurance policy against the risk of paying expenses and disbursements if you lose, or some or all of your opponent’s costs even if you win. You will be responsible for paying the insurance premium for this if you win. If you lose the premium is not payable. Full details are contained in the insurance policy documents. We will give further information about insurance policies to you so that you can decide whether you wish to take one out.</span>
			<br>
			The parties acknowledge and agree that this agreement is not a Contentious Business Agreement within the terms of the Solicitors Act 1974.<br><br>
			<span class="ppi-bold">Note: We are not bound to act on a conditional fee basis until both you and we have signed this agreement.</span>



			<br><br>
			<span class="ppi-bold">Schedule 1</span><br>
			<span class="ppi-bold">Success fee</span><br><br>


			The success fee is set at 100% of our basic charges, where the claim concludes
			at trial; or 100% where the claim concludes before a trial has commenced.<br><br>

			The success fee percentage reflects the following:<br><br>
			<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; ">
				<li>the fact that if you lose, we will not earn anything;
				</li>
				<li>our assessment of the risks of your case;
				</li>
				<li>any other appropriate matters;
				</li>
				<li>the fact that if you win we will not be paid our basic charges until the end of the claim;
				</li>
				<li>our arrangements with you about paying expenses and disbursements.
				</li>
				<li>the arrangements about payment of our costs if your opponent makes a Part 36 offer or payment which you reject on our advice, and your claim for damages goes ahead to trial where you recover damages that are less than that offer or payment.
				</li>
			</ol><br>
			The Success Fee cannot be more than 100% of the basic charges in total.<br><br>
			<span style="text-decoration:underline;">You also have the right to apply to the court for assessment of our costs, including  our success fee.</span>
<br><br>



			<br><br>
			<br><br>
			<span class="ppi-bold">Schedule 2</span><br>
			<span class="ppi-bold">Basic Charges</span><br>
			These are for work done from now until this agreement ends. These are subject to review.
			<br><br>
			<span class="ppi-bold">How we calculate our basic charges</span><br>
			These are calculated for each hour engaged on your matter. Routine letters and telephone calls will be charged as units of one tenth of an hour. Other letters and telephone calls will be charged on a time basis. The hourly rates are:

			<span class="ppi-bold">Law Society Conditions</span>
			<br>

			The Law Society Conditions below are part of this agreement. Any amendments or additions to them will apply to you. You should read the conditions carefully and ask us about anything you find unclear.
			<br><br>
			<b>Our responsibilities</b> We must:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>always act in your best interests, subject to our duty to the court;
				</li>
				<li>explain to you the risks and benefits of taking legal action;
				</li>
				<li>give you our best advice about whether to accept any offer of settlement;
				</li>
				<li>give you the best information possible about the likely costs of your claim for damages.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br>


			<b>Your responsibilities</b> You must:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>give us instructions that allow us to do our work properly;
				</li>
				<li>not ask us to work in an improper or unreasonable way;
				</li>
				<li>not deliberately mislead us;
				</li>
				<li>co-operate with us;
				</li>
				<li>go to any medical or expert examination or court hearing.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br><br>

			<b>Dealing with costs if you win</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Subject to any overall cap agreed with you, you are liable to pay all our basic charges, our expenses and disbursements and the success fee (up to the maximum limit) together with the premium of any insurance policy you take out.
				</li>
				<li>Normally, you can claim part or all of our basic charges and our expenses and disbursements from your opponent. You provide us with your irrevocable agreement to pursue such a claim on your behalf. However, you cannot claim from your opponent the success fees or the premium of any insurance policy you take out.
				</li>
				<li>If we and your opponent cannot agree the amount, the court will decide how much you can recover. If the amount agreed or allowed by the court does not cover all our basic charges and our expenses and disbursements, then you pay the difference up to any maximum agreed with you.
				</li>
				<li>You, not your opponent, pay our success fee and any insurance premium.
				</li>
				<li>You agree that after winning, the reasons for setting the success fee at the amount stated may be disclosed to the court and any other person required by the court.
				</li>
				<li>If your opponent is receiving Community Legal Service funding, we are unlikely to get any money from him or her. So if this happens, you have to pay us our basic charges, expenses and disbursements and success fee.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			We are allowed to keep any interest your opponent pays on the charges.
			<br><br>
			You agree to pay into a designated account any cheque received by you or by us from your opponent and made payable to you. Out of the money, you agree to let us take the balance of the basic charges; success fee; insurance premium; our remaining expenses and disbursements; and VAT.
			<br><br>
			You take the rest.
			<br><br>
			<i>If your opponent fails to pay monies due to you</i>
			<br><br>
			If your opponent does not pay any damages or charges owed to you, we have the right to take recovery action in your name to enforce a judgment, order or agreement. The charges of this action become part of the basic charges.
			<br><br>
			<b>Payment for advocacy</b>
			The cost of advocacy and any other work by us, or by any solicitor agent on our behalf, forms part of our basic charges. We shall discuss with you the identity of any barrister instructed, and the arrangements made for payment.
			<br><br>
			<i>Barristers who have a conditional fee agreement with us</i>
			<br><br>
			If you win, you are normally entitled to recover their fee from your opponent, but not their success fee. The barrister's success fee is shown in the separate conditional fee agreement we make with the barrister. You must pay the barrister’s success fee shown in the separate conditional fee agreement we make with the barrister. We will discuss the barrister’s success fee with you before we instruct him or her. If you lose, you pay the barrister nothing.
			<br><br>
			<b>The barrister’s success fee is NOT included within the maximum limit to the recoverable success fee in proceedings at first instance as explained in Schedule 1.</b>
			<br><br>
			<i>Barristers who do not have a conditional fee agreement with us</i>
			<br><br>
			If you win, then you will normally be entitled to recover all or part of their fee from your opponent. If you lose, then you must pay their fee.
			<br><br>
			<b>Payment for Surveyor’s fees</b>
			If you fail to cancel an arranged inspection within 48 hours of it being due to take place, you will be charge a ‘Did Not Attend’ fee of £100.00. This fee is applicable to each failed inspection and will be deducted from any damages recovered at the conclusion of the claim.
			<br><br>
			<b>What happens when this agreement ends before your claim for damages ends?
			<br><br>
			<i> (a) Paying us if you end this agreement</i></b>
			<br><br>
			You can end the agreement at any time. Unless you have a right to cancel this agreement under Schedule 3 and do so within the 7 day time limit we then have the right to decide whether you must pay our basic charges and our expenses and disbursements including barristers’ fees but not the success fee when we ask for them; or
			<br>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>
				pay our basic charges, and our expenses and disbursements including barristers’ fees and success fees if you go on to win your claim for damages.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<b><i>(b) Paying us if we end this agreement</i></b><br>
			<ol>
				<li>We can end this agreement if you do not keep to your responsibilities. We then have the right to decide whether you must:
					<br>
					<ul>
						<li>pay our basic charges and our expenses and disbursements including barristers’ fees but not the success fee when we ask for them; or</li>
						<li>pay our basic charges and our expenses and disbursements including barristers’ fees and success fees if you go on to win your claim for damages.</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
				</li>
				<li>We can end this agreement if we believe you are unlikely to win. If this happens,   you will only have to pay our expenses and disbursements. These will include barristers’ fees if the barrister does not have a conditional fee agreement with us.</li>
				<li>We can end this agreement if you reject our opinion about making a settlement  with your opponent. You must then:
					<br><br>
					<ul>
						<li>pay the basic charges and our expenses and disbursements, including barristers’ fees;</li>
						<li>pay the success fee if you go on to win your claim for damages.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<br><br>
			If you ask us to get a second opinion from a specialist solicitor outside our firm, we will do so. You pay the cost of a second opinion.
			[(iv) We can end this agreement if you do not pay your insurance premium when asked to do so.
			<br><br>
			<b><i>(c) Death</i></b><br>
			This agreement automatically ends if you die before your claim for damages is concluded. We will be entitled to recover our basic charges up to the date of your death from your estate.
			<br><br>
			If your personal representatives wish to continue your claim for damages, we may offer them a new conditional fee agreement, as long as they agree to pay the success fee on our basic charges from the beginning of the agreement with you.
			<br><br>
			<b>What happens after this agreement ends</b>
			<br>
			After this agreement ends, we may apply to have our name removed from the record of any court proceedings in which we are acting unless you have another form of funding and ask us to work for you.
			<br><br>
			We have the right to preserve our lien unless another solicitor working for you undertakes to pay us what we are owed including a success fee if you win.
