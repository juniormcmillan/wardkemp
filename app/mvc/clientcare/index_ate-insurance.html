							<li id="3_1">Insuring Against Losing</li>
							<div class="ppi-agreement-info" >
								Although we believe your claim is likely to succeed, we will be arranging insurance to cover you against the risk of you either losing your claim or having deductions made from the damages you recover. This sort of insurance is called After The Event insurance (“ATE Insurance”) and is necessary in order to protect you financially. As we have explained above, if your claim is unsuccessful you will not normally be liable for this firm’s costs, but there are a number of reasons why you need ATE Insurance:<br><br>
								a) If you lose your claim you <b>may have to pay our expenses</b> (called disbursements) i.e. what we may have to pay on your behalf for items such as an expert’s report, court fees and barrister’s fees for both advice and court appearances as necessary. These may run to many thousands of pounds - much will depend on what stage your case has reached, the value of your claim and whether the Defendant agrees to settle with you.<br><br>


								b) If you lose your claim, and proceedings have been issued then you will usually have to pay your opponent’s recoverable costs, disbursements and VAT (“the Defendant's Costs”).<br><br>

								How much costs you might be liable to pay for the Defendant’s Costs is very difficult to say at this point, as much will depend on when the case settles and whether your case is a small claim, a fast track claim or a multi-track claim. Claims with a value of less than £10,000 will usually be treated as a small claim, where costs are fixed and usually limited to only a few hundred pounds, but courts do have a discretion to allocate any claim to the fast track if they feel the case is too complicated to be dealt with as a small claim. Fast track costs will typically be many thousands of pounds by the time a case reaches trial, but any claim with a value of more than £25,000 will normally be treated as a multi-track claim where Defendant’s costs may be tens of thousands of pounds.<br><br>

								Explaining all of the circumstances in which you may have to pay the Defendant's Costs is quite complex, but a brief summary of the costs risks which necessitate ATE Insurance, is as follows:<br><br>

								i)	If your claim is unsuccessful then the normal rule is that the Defendant can recover from you the costs disbursements and VAT which they reasonably and necessarily incurred in defending your claim, but what you pay will be limited to relatively low fixed costs if the case is dealt with as a small claim.<br><br>

								ii)	Even if your claim is successful, you may have to pay some of the Defendant's Costs. The most likely circumstance where this would occur is if you “failed to beat the Defendant’s offer”. This would happen if the Defendant offered you Compensation which you refused to accept (normally because the offer seemed too low) but later in the case you were forced to accept that offer (or a lower offer) or the court awarded you the same amount as the Defendant had offered (or less). If you ended up with less than the Defendant had offered, then you would have to pay the Defendant's Costs from 21 days after their offer, until the end of the case. This could substantially reduce the net Compensation you received or if the costs awarded against you were greater than the Compensation you received, you would have a net overall liability to the Defendant even if your claim had been successful.<br><br>

								iii)	Another circumstance where you would normally be liable for costs is where (as part of the process leading to an eventual trial) you or the Defendant made an application to the court about anything concerning your case, and the court ruled in favour of the Defendant and (as is normal) then awarded costs against you.<br><br><br>


								If we need to instruct a barrister, having ATE insurance may (depending on the barrister arrangements) avoid you having to pay your barrister a “success fee” out of any Compensation you receive, and so may save you money even where your claim is successful.<br><br>
								Because of these risks and advantages, we strongly recommend that you should buy ATE Insurance to protect yourself. We recommend that you obtain a policy from Leeward Insurance Company Limited (“Leeward”) which we will purchase on your behalf to provide that protection.<br><br>
								The premium is £50 plus IPT if the case settles pre-issue, but we pay this out of our charges, so you will not have to pay this yourself. If the case settles after proceedings are issued, then a further £336.40 will be incurred (£386.40 in total). The price of the premium will not vary during the lifetime of your claim, but the government may change the rate of IPT from time to time which may increase the overall premium – IPT must be paid at the time when your premium is paid.<br><br>
								It is important to note that if a policy is purchased at a later point in your claim then the premium will be more expensive than above.  It is better to insure the claim at the outset to make sure that you have cover for all eventualities, such as if we need to issue proceedings or a formal offer is received, and to enable you to secure the cheapest premium.<br><br>
								The benefits of the policy (as well as its key terms and exclusions) are set out in the attached “Insurance Product Information Document” (section 3.6 below), but we would specifically mention:<br><br>
								•	You do not have to pay anything for this policy now.<br>
								•	If your claim is unsuccessful you do not have to pay for this policy.<br>
								•	If your claim is successful, the premium will be deducted from the damages you recover.<br>
								•	The policy gives you the ability to ensure that the Defendant pays you the correct level of damages because you can confidently reject a damages offer which is too low (if we advise you to) and if you later receive less than the sum you rejected, the policy will pay your liability for the Defendant's costs. This benefit alone may well outweigh the cost of the premium.<br><br>
								Unless you instruct us otherwise, we will arrange for a Leeward insurance policy to be taken out to protect you against the risks set out above. In doing so you will be agreeing to allow the insurer, our agents Box Legal Limited and our lenders, to inspect your file and receive ongoing information from us regarding the progress of your case and its outcome. You will also be agreeing with Leeward that we can act on your behalf to ensure that the policy terms are complied with and that any policy premium received  from the Defendant is held in trust for your insurers, until the premium is paid. Most importantly, your instructing us to proceed will constitute your irrevocable agreement to allow us to receive your damages and to deduct the appropriate premium from the damages and to send it to the insurer in settlement of the liability to pay the premium.<br><br>

							<li id="3_2">Existing Insurance Policy </li>
							<div class="ppi-agreement-info" >
								Although unlikely, you may already have a legal expense insurance policy which will cover you for this claim, which would mean there may be no need for us to arrange a further policy for you.<br><br>

								You may have a stand-alone legal expense insurance policy in place, although more commonly legal expense insurance policies are offered and attached to other insurance products, such as your home or motor insurance policies, an insurance policy that was arranged with a credit card or through your bank account or travel insurance. Please also check whether any organisation (eg. a union) provides legal expenses cover.<br><br>

								We therefore ask you to please check all your insurance policies (or organisation membership terms) to see if any contain legal expense cover. If they do, it is possible that the cover is restricted to certain claim types only and there may be other conditions on when and how any case should be pursued, e.g. you may be required to instruct a new solicitor who is on that insurer’s panel.<br><br>

								We therefore suggest that you forward to us a copy of any legal expense policy (or membership terms) you discover, so that we can advise you on the terms of the policy and whether it is suitable for this case.<br><br>

								Please note that Leeward Insurance Company Limited is incorporated in Bermuda and is regulated in Bermuda by the Bermuda Monetary Authority under the Bermuda Insurance Act 1978 as amended. Any transaction with Leeward Insurance Company Limited will not fall within any Compensation scheme, but you have the right to refer any dispute under the policy to the Isle of Man Financial Services Ombudsman in the Isle of Man. Alternatively, any dispute under the policy will be dealt with by an arbitrator appointed where necessary by the Law Society in accordance with the “Arbitration” section of the ClaimSafe policy. The policy is governed by English law. We have carefully considered the effect of this on your behalf, and we are satisfied that overall, taking into account all reasons which might lead to non-payment, there is a very low risk of non-payment of claims, and indeed this policy appears to be superior in this regard to many on the market. Please let us know if you would like further details.<br><br>
								Please also note that as with many insurance policies, our relationship with Leeward Insurance Company Limited is intended to be long-term and a high level of claims on the ClaimSafe policies which we take out for our clients may prejudice that relationship and eventually increase premiums or involve payments which this firm may be responsible for. If in the future the circumstances of your own case, materially conflicts with ours then we will recommend that Counsel’s advice should be obtained on those areas of conflict, for which the policy will pay any irrecoverable costs.<br><br>

							<li id="3_4">Authorisation</li>
							<div class="ppi-agreement-info" >
								We are not authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority. However, we are included on the register maintained by the Financial Conduct Authority so that we may carry on insurance distribution activity, which is broadly the advising on, selling and administration of insurance contracts. This part of our business, including arrangements for complaints or redress if something goes wrong, is regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority by whom we are authorised. The register can be accessed via the Financial Conduct website at <a href='www.fca.org.uk/firms/financial-services-register'>www.fca.org.uk/firms/financial-services-register</a>.

								We would advise you however that we are not insurance brokers. The legal expenses insurance market is complex and changes frequently. Accordingly we do not offer professional advice on all policies available in the market.<br><br>
								We only deal with products from Leeward Insurance Company Limited for legal expenses insurance policies, but we are not contractually obliged to conduct business in this way.<br><br>
