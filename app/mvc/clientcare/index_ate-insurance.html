				Protecting Yourself Financially (ATE Legal Expense Insurance)
				</h2>

				<h3>Insuring Against Losing</h3>

				<div class="ppi-agreement-info" >
					Although we believe your claim is likely to succeed, we will be arranging insurance to cover you against the risk of you either losing your claim or having deductions made from the damages you recover. This sort of insurance is called After The Event insurance (“ATE Insurance”) and is necessary in order to protect you financially. As we have explained, if your claim is unsuccessful, you will not be liable for this firm’s costs, but there are a number of reasons why you need ATE Insurance:

					<br><br>
					<ol class="dasda" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; ">
						<li>
							If you lose your claim you <b>would have to pay our expenses</b> (called disbursements) i.e. what we may have to pay on your behalf for items such as your medical records, an accident report, at least one medical report (necessary to detail your injuries) as well as court fees and counsel’s fees for both advice and court appearances if necessary. These may run to many thousands of pounds - much will depend on whether the defendant agrees to settle with you, and if so at what stage.<br><br>

						</li>
						<li>
							If you lose your claim, you will usually have to pay your opponent’s recoverable costs, disbursements and VAT (“the Defendant's Costs”). These will normally total many thousands of pounds but again the exact sum is difficult to predict at this stage and will obviously depend on the stage at which your claim settles. Explaining all of the circumstances in which you may have to pay the Defendant's Costs is quite complex, but a brief summary of the costs risks which necessitate ATE Insurance, is as follows:<br><br>
							<ol class="dasda" style="list-style-type: lower-roman; ">
								<li>
									If your claim is unsuccessful then the normal rule is that the defendant can recover from you the costs disbursements and VAT which they reasonably and necessarily incurred in defending your claim.<br><br>
								</li>
								<li>
									Even if your claim is successful, you may have to pay some of the Defendant's Costs. The most likely circumstance where this would occur is if you “failed to beat the defendant’s offer”. This would happen if the defendant offered you compensation which you refused to accept (normally because the offer seemed too low) but later in the case you were forced to accept that offer (or a lower offer) or the court awarded you the same amount as the defendant had offered (or less). If you ended up with less than the defendant had offered, then you would have to pay the Defendant's Costs from 21 days after their offer, until the end of the case. This could substantially reduce the net compensation you received or if the costs awarded against you were greater than the compensation you received, you would have a net overall liability to the defendant even if your claim had been successful.<br><br>
								</li>
								<li>
									Another circumstance where you would normally be liable for costs is where (as part of the process leading to an eventual trial) you or the defendant made an application to the court about anything concerning your case, and the court ruled in favour of the defendant and (as is normal) then awarded costs against you.<br><br><br>
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							If we need to instruct a barrister, having ATE insurance may (depending on the barrister arrangements) avoid you having to pay your barrister a “success fee” out of any compensation you receive, and so may save you money even where your claim is successful.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<br>

					Because of these risks and advantages, we strongly recommend that you should buy ATE insurance to protect yourself. We recommend that you obtain a policy from Leeward Insurance Company Limited (“Leeward”) which we will purchase on your behalf to provide that protection.
					<br><br>
					To purchase this policy now, the premium is £795 plus IPT at the rate when the premium is paid (currently 12%). The price of the premium will not vary during the lifetime of your claim, but the government do change the rate of IPT from time to time.
					<br><br>
					It is important to note that if a policy is purchased at a later point in your claim then the premium will be more expensive than above.  It is better to insure the claim at the outset to make sure that you have cover for all eventualities, such as we need to issue proceedings or a formal offer is received, and to guarantee that you are securing the cheapest premium.
					<br><br>
					The benefits of the policy (as well as its key terms and exclusions) are set out in the attached “Insurance Product Information Document” (IPID), but we would specifically mention:
					<br>
					<br>
					<ul>
						<li>You do not have to pay anything for this policy now.
						</li>
						<li>If your claim is unsuccessful do not have to pay for this policy.
						</li>
						<li>If your claim is successful, the premium will be deducted from the damages you recover
						</li>
						<li>The policy gives you the ability to ensure that the defendant pays you the correct level of damages because you can confidently reject a damages offer which is too low (if we advise you to) and if you later receive less than the sum you rejected, the policy will pay your liability for the defendant's costs. This benefit alone may well outweigh the cost of the premium.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<br>
					We would advise you however that we are not insurance brokers. The legal expenses insurance market is complex and changes frequently. Accordingly we do not offer professional advice on all policies available in the market.
					<br>
					<br>
					Unless you instruct us otherwise, we will arrange for a Leeward insurance policy to be taken out to protect you against the risks set out above. In doing so you will be agreeing to allow the insurer and our agents Box Legal Limited, to inspect your file and receive ongoing information from us regarding the progress of your case and its outcome. You will also be agreeing with Leeward that we can act on your behalf to ensure that the policy terms are complied with and that any policy premium received and your right (if any) to recover it from the defendant(s) is held in trust for your insurers, until the premium is paid. Most importantly, your instructing us to proceed will constitute your irrevocable agreement to allow us to receive your damages and to deduct the appropriate premium from the damages and to send it to the insurer in settlement of the liability to pay the premium.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Pre-existing Cover</b>
					<br>
					<br>
					We have separately asked you to check if you have any pre-existing legal expense insurance policy which might this claim (commonly referred to as Before The Event insurance).
					<br><br>
					While these checks might still be continuing we will arrange an ATE insurance policy on a provisional basis pending your full instructions and our enquires with any BTE insurer/cover you find. We consider that it is in your best interests for your claim to be pursued promptly and without delay.
					<br><br>
					Where you have advised us that you may already have existing insurance cover for this type of risk we will continue to attempt to obtain indemnity from your insurer. Where it is confirmed that you have pre-existing insurance in place and indemnity is granted under that policy by your existing insurer, we confirm that we will review matters carefully. If, once the position is confirmed, it is our view that the ATE policy should be cancelled without any cost or other obligation on your part, then we will arrange for the ATE policy to be cancelled.
					<br><br>
					If we cannot obtain cover from your existing insurer, we recommend keeping the new policy in force as such cover can be prohibitively expensive if taken out at a later stage in any legal proceedings.
					<br><br>
					Should you wish to cancel the policy at this stage, then there is a 14 day cooling off period.
					<br><br>
					<b>The Insurer</b>
					<br><br>
					Please note that Leeward Insurance Company Limited is incorporated in Bermuda and is regulated in Bermuda by the Bermuda Monetary Authority under the Bermuda Insurance Act 1978 as amended. Any transaction with Leeward Insurance Company Limited will not fall within any compensation scheme, but you have the right to refer any dispute under the policy to the Financial Ombudsman Service in the United Kingdom. Alternatively, any dispute under the policy will be dealt with by an arbitrator appointed where necessary by the Law Society in accordance with the “Arbitration” section of the ClaimSafe policy. The policy is governed by English law. We have carefully considered the effect of this on your behalf, and we are satisfied that overall, taking into account all reasons which might lead to non-payment, there is a very low risk of non-payment of claims, and indeed this policy appears to be superior in this regard to many on the market. Please let us know if you would like further details.
					<br><br>
					Please also note that as with many insurance policies, our relationship with Leeward Insurance Company Limited is intended to be long-term and a high level of claims on the ClaimSafe policies which we take out for our clients may prejudice that relationship and eventually increase premiums or involve payments which this firm may be responsible for. If in the future the circumstances of your own case, materially conflicts with ours then we will recommend that Counsel’s advice should be obtained on those areas of conflict, for which the policy will pay any irrecoverable costs.
					<br><br>
					<b>Authorisation</b>
					<br><br>
					We are not authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority. However, we are included on the register maintained by the Financial Conduct Authority so that we may carry on insurance mediation activity, which is broadly the advising on, selling and administration of insurance contracts. This part of our business, including arrangements for complaints or redress if something goes wrong, is regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority. The register can be accessed via the Financial Conduct website at www.fsa.gov.uk/register/epfSearchForm.do
					<br><br>
					The Law Society of England and Wales is a designated professional body for the purposes of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The Solicitors Regulation Authority is the independent regulatory arm of the Law Society. The Legal Ombudsman deals with complaints against lawyers. If you are unhappy with any insurance advice you receive from us, you should raise your concerns with either of those bodies.
					<br><br>
					<b>Products</b>
					<br><br>
					We only select products from a limited number of insurers for legal expenses insurance policies, but we are not contractually obliged to conduct business in this way.  Ask us for a list of the insurers.
					<br><br>

					Yours faithfully<br>
					For and on behalf of<br>
